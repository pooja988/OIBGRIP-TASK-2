             Subhash Chandra Bose is one of India's most famous and most independent freedom fighters.
             Subhash Chandra Bose was so passionate about India's independence that he joined hands 
             with Germany's government in World War II and with the help of Germans, he spread a word in India
              that freedom is very close, and all against the British Must get to fight.
    </br>
             He was born on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack, and was deeply impressed by the teachings of 
             Swami Vivekananda. They came to know that religion is more important than their studies
              and soon they become nationalists in opposition to various problems that apply to Indians.

             Bose planned that according to which he wanted the youth of India to move forward and 
             participate in the freedom struggle, he was successful in his plan because a large number
              of people used to join hands with him for the freedom struggle. Their conversation among 
              the youth is quite clear in everyone's memoirs "You Muj Kho Da Do, Main You Freedom Donga".
              He started a newspaper called Swaraj and started printing a lot against the British rule 
              and the work being done by him. People became more aware and started supporting Subhash 
              Chandra for those tasks which he was doing.
    </br>
             He was known as a great leader, and this is why he managed to manage a great youth army easily.
              He was brave to fight with a powerful British army, and it is worth noting that Subhash Chandra 
              Bose had a great hand in India's freedom fight.

             The people of India know that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had done a lot for him, but in fact
              his deeds were so important, nobody is aware of it. He was the gem of personality and India 
              never saw any personality like him after his death.
